Q. You are loading ads after page load using setTimeout.
 Why does the ad load after the main content even if the timeout is 0ms? (Callback Queue)

> Why Ads Load Later?

    Browser must:
    Execute current JavaScript
    Render UI
    Clear call stack

> Only then the callback moves from Callback Queue → Call Stack

> This ensures:

    Main content loads first
    Ads or heavy scripts load later
