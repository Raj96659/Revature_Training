Q. A web page has a button that logs "Start", then uses setTimeout to log "Async Task", and finally logs "End".
 Explain the execution order using Call Stack, Callback Queue, and Event Loop. (Call Stack & Event Loop)


JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can execute only one task at a time.

To handle asynchronous operations, JavaScript uses:
    Call Stack
    Callback Queue
    Event Loop

Step-by-step Execution

1. When the button is clicked, "Start" is pushed to the Call Stack and executed.

2. setTimeout() registers the callback and sends it to the Callback Queue (even if delay is 0ms).

3. "End" is synchronous, so it executes immediately.

4. The Event Loop continuously checks:

    Is Call Stack empty?

    If yes → move callback from Callback Queue to Call Stack.

5. "Async Task" is finally executed.

Output Order :

Start
End
Async Task
